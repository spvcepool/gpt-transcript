# gpt-transcript
This project aims to develop a method for accessing real-time transcription of ChatGPTâ€™s voice mode interactions, intended to enhance the usability of ChatGPT.




//
message break tag = [break_message_convo]

at the beginning of each message there will be a tag to know who it is
user messages = [user_1_message]
chatgpt message = [gpt_1_message]


I forgot to tell you I am also going to have tags at the beginning of each message that will let me know if it's a user message or GPT message . The tags are the following

user messages = [user_1_message]
chatgpt message = [gpt_1_message]

And I want and just so you know I want and just so you know I want to use this text to display it and I'll pop-up I was thinking HTML and CSS to end the pop-up I wanted to display the transcript as a conversation so there would be the user on the right and ChatGPT on the left like a normal message conversation like on iPhone
